<h1>parts<a class="headerlink" href="#parts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The ensemble is divided into three groups of performers. For the respective actions, abruptly change intensities according to the notation (avoid soft transitions at elisions, as well as at the starting and stopping points of actions adjacent to silence). Assume the same point in an action upon reentry after silence - in other words, begin again where you last ended.</p>
<div class="section" id="lungs">
<h2>lungs<a class="headerlink" href="#lungs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>(bass flute, oboe, bass clarinet, contrabassoon, french horn, trumpet, trombone)</strong></p>
<p>Each player performs the lowest sound of air (without distinct pitch). Sustain the sound for as long as possible (relative to the level of intensity) for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>At the end of each breath (just before you run out of air), change your fingering / positioning (if necessary) in order to perform a very short, audible &#8220;C&#8221; note at the lowest possible pitch on your instrument. This note should always occur at a very low volume, probably sounding somewhere between the least and middle intensity levels. It&#8217;s okay if the note doesn&#8217;t happen - that is preferable to it happening too loudly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="guts">
<h2>guts<a class="headerlink" href="#guts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>(two percussions, harp, piano)</strong></p>
<p>Thread four long pieces of thick parachute cord (paracord) under the respective pitches as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>percussion 1 and 2</em>: F, 8 semitones above the second-lowest A, and E, 11 semitones above that (perc. 1 begins with E)</li>
<li><em>piano and harp</em>: the lowest A, and the second-lowest A (piano begins with second-lowest A)</li>
</ul>
<p>The two pairs are positioned with partners facing each other from opposite sides of the piano. The partners for each pair will share two paracords, pulling one for either pitch and gradually wrapping it around their hand (rather than continuously pulling back with arm), and providing slight resistance for the other cord. It doesn&#8217;t particularly matter which cord is in which hand, so long as the two aren&#8217;t criss-crossing. When one of the players runs out of cord, switch directions (pull the other, provide resistence for the previously pulled one).</p>
<p>The players will each pull their own cord at a speed relative to the intensity marking (top line is medium-slow, middle is medium-fast, and bottom line is fast). The sound doesn&#8217;t need to be consistent, but the patterns of motion should be (at least per player - across players, the winding of the cord may differ, and that&#8217;s okay). The relative speeds should be roughly the same across players, and this should be mutually agreed upon as a group, factoring in necessary resistance and how well the sound is being projected in the space.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="necks">
<h2>necks<a class="headerlink" href="#necks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>(two violins, viola, violoncello, double bass)</strong></p>
<p>Each player tunes their lowest string as low as they are willing, but not so loose that the string might flop out of the instrument. The violinists and violist should have their instruments in resting position, with the body planted on their laps and instrument positioned upright (they will bow just like the cellist / bassist do).</p>
<p><em>Each player</em>: With your left hand positioned roughly halfway between the scroll and the body, clasp the neck. Let your fingers or palm mute all four strings with at least gentle pressure - the lowest string shouldn&#8217;t be muted more than that.</p>
<p>The intensity markings for you represent speed alone: slow (top line), medium, and fast - <em>slow</em> being at a rate of roughly 10 seconds per bow, and <em>fast</em> at roughly 1 second per bow. The speeds do not have to be coordinated between players; whether the patterns are in sync or gradually offset isn&#8217;t important - just try not to listen too closely, and simply let the pattern unfold however.</p>
<p>Maintaining a relatively consistent light pressure, bow the lowest string. Always complete the bow before changing directions - this means that you might change speeds in the middle of a bow.</p>
<p>At the very end of each down bow, no matter what speed you are currently bowing, change to the second-lowest string. Apply a harsh pressure to the string - the result should be some sort of crunchy / squeaky / gross sound (the point is to articulate the moment without any really particular / distinct sound). This should always happen for just a brief second, and the volume of this sound shouldn&#8217;t ever be too loud - but it should be somewhere between the average and loudest sounds in the ensemble. Then switch back to the lowest string.</p>
<p>Begin the piece with a down bow.</p>
