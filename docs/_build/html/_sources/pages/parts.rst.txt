The ensemble is divided into three groups of performers. For the respective actions, abruptly change intensities according to the notation (avoid soft transitions at elisions, as well as at the starting and stopping points of actions adjacent to silence). Assume the same point in an action upon reentry after silence - in other words, begin again where you last ended.
