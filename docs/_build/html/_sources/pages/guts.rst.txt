Thread four long pieces of thick parachute cord (paracord) under the respective pitches as follows:

- *percussion 1 and 2*: F, 8 semitones above the second-lowest A, and E, 11 semitones above that (perc. 1 begins with E)
- *piano and harp*: the lowest A, and the second-lowest A (piano begins with second-lowest A)

The two pairs are positioned with partners facing each other from opposite sides of the piano. The partners for each pair will share two paracords, pulling one for either pitch and gradually wrapping it around their hand (rather than continuously pulling back with arm), and providing slight resistance for the other cord. It doesn't particularly matter which cord is in which hand, so long as the two aren't criss-crossing. When one of the players runs out of cord, switch directions (pull the other, provide resistence for the previously pulled one).

The players will each pull their own cord at a speed relative to the intensity marking (top line is medium-slow, middle is medium-fast, and bottom line is fast). The sound doesn't need to be consistent, but the patterns of motion should be (at least per player - across players, the winding of the cord may differ, and that's okay). The relative speeds should be roughly the same across players, and this should be mutually agreed upon as a group, factoring in necessary resistance and how well the sound is being projected in the space.
