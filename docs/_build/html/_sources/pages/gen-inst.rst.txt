general instructions
====================

The importance of any moment - and that of any part - isn't explicitly denoted in the score (i.e. conventional expressive markings are entirely withheld). The purpose of this minimal construction is to reduce the immediate facade of the piece (the score) for the players and, through their performance, the sound itself - and the listener's / feeler's experience thereof.

the score
---------

Each player performs three variations of some action. An *action* might be a single gesture or a simple pattern, either of which is sustained / repeated for the duration of the event. The parameters and rules for these actions vary slightly per subset of players, but for the most part the ensemble should feel similarly designed and hierarchically unified throughout the performance.

The topmost line represents the least intensity of sound (so less pressure / volume) which should be, for the most part, inaudible; the middle line is only slightly more intense, and the bottom line just slightly more intense than that. The loudest sounds produced should still be reasonably considered **weak** or **quiet**. The performance in its entirity should come across as emphatically (maybe even obnoxiously) soft. Always hold back.
