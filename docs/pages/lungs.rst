Each player performs the lowest sound of air (without distinct pitch). Sustain the sound for as long as possible (relative to the level of intensity) for the duration of the event.

At the end of each breath (just before you run out of air), change your fingering / positioning (if necessary) in order to perform a very short, audible "C" note at the lowest possible pitch on your instrument. This note should always occur at a very low volume, probably sounding somewhere between the least and middle intensity levels. It's okay if the note doesn't happen - that is preferable to it happening too loudly. Then, quickly reset your breath, taking no more than about half a second to do so, and doing so inaudibly, almost secretly.
