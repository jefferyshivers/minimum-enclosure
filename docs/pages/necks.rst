Each player tunes their lowest string as low as they are willing, but not so loose that the string might flop out of the instrument. The violinists and violist should have their instruments in resting position, with the body planted on their laps and instrument positioned upright (they will bow just like the cellist / bassist do).

*Each player*: With your left hand positioned roughly halfway between the scroll and the body, clasp the neck. Let your fingers or palm mute all four strings with at least gentle pressure - the lowest string shouldn't be muted more than that.

The intensity markings for you represent speed alone: slow (top line), medium, and fast - *slow* being at a rate of roughly 10 seconds per bow, and *fast* at roughly 1 second per bow. The speeds do not have to be coordinated between players; whether the patterns are in sync or gradually offset isn't important - just try not to listen too closely, and simply let the pattern unfold however.

Maintaining a relatively consistent light pressure, bow the lowest string. Always complete the bow before changing directions - this means that you might change speeds in the middle of a bow.

At the very end of each down bow, no matter what speed you are currently bowing, change to the second-lowest string. Apply a harsh pressure to the string - the result should be some sort of crunchy / squeaky / gross sound (the point is to articulate the moment without any really particular / distinct sound). This should always happen for just a brief second, and the volume of this sound shouldn't ever be too loud - but it should be somewhere between the average and loudest sounds in the ensemble. Then switch back to the lowest string.

Begin the piece with a down bow.
