introduction
============

Each player performs a subset of three actions.

The importance of any moment - and that of any part - isn't explicitly denoted in the score (i.e. dynamics and expressive markings are entirely withheld). The purpose of this minimal construction is to reduce the immediate facade of the piece for the players and, through that reduction, to focus more .. on how every feature fits within its surrounding context *in the moment*.
