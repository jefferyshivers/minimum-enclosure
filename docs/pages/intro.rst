In short, this is the soft stroke of a single color on an infinite black canvas. The stroke is too soft to understand much about the brush, but nonethess the color is there, albeit visibly weak, uneven and quickly drying.

Attempt not to feel or express feelings, and avoid listening too closely with your ears.
