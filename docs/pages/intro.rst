introduction
============

This is the stroke of a pale, dusty paint on an infinite and tattered black canvas. The stroke is too soft to understand much about the brush, but nonethess the color is there, albeit quite transparent, weak and quickly drying as the canvas gives way under the weight of almost nothing.

**NOTE about the piece:** This isn't factored into the composition / score, but if the space is quite large, it may be helpful to mic / amplify the ensemble.
