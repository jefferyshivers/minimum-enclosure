Thread four long pieces of thick parachute cord (paracord) under the respective pitches as follows:

- *percussion 1*: E, 11 semitones above the second percussionist's F
- *percussion 2*: F, 8 semitones above the second-lowest A
- *piano*: the second-lowest A
- *harp*: the lowest A

The four players should split into two pairs, each of which is positioned with partners facing each other from opposite sides of the piano. The partners for each pair will share two paracord strings, pulling one for their own pitch by wrapping it around their hand, and providing slight resistance for the other string. It doesn't particularly matter which cord is in which hand, so long as the two aren't criss-crossing. When one of the players runs out of string, switch directions (pull the other, provide resistence for the previously pulled one).

The players will each pull their own cord at a speed relative to the intensity marking (top line is medium-slow, middle is medium-fast, and bottom line is fast). The sound doesn't need to be consistent, but the patterns of motion should be (at least per player - across players, the winding of the cord may differ, and that's okay). The relative speeds should be roughly the same across players, and this should be mutually agreed upon as a group, factoring in necessary resistance and how well the sound is being projected in the space.
